        <h1 class="title">The Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears</h1>

        <p class="content">Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in.</p>
        
        <p class="content">At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.</p>
        
        <p class="content">"This porridge is too hot!" she exclaimed.</p>
        
        <p class="content">So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl.</p>
        
        <p class="content">"This porridge is too cold," she said.</p>
        
        <p class="content">So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge.</p>
        
        <p class="content">"Ahhh, this porridge is just right," she said happily and she ate it all up.</p>
